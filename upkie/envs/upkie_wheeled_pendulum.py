    Environment where Upkie is used as a wheeled inverted pendulum.

    The environment id is ``UpkieWheeledPendulum-v1``.

    See for instance this note on the [wheeled inverted pendulum
    model](https://scaron.info/robotics/wheeled-inverted-pendulum-model.html).

    ### Action space

    Vectorized actions have the following structure:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Index</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
            </tr>

            <td>``0``</td>
            <td>Ground velocity in [m] / [s].</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    ### Observation space

    Vectorized observations have the following structure:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Index</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
