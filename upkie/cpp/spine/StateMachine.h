/*! Spine state machine.
 *
 * The overall specification of the state machine is summarized in the
 * following diagram:
 *
 * \image html state-machine.png
 * \image latex state-machine.eps
 *
 * States have the following purposes:
 *
 * - Stop: do nothing, send stop commands to servos
 * - Reset: apply runtime configuration to actuation interface and observers
 *   - The reset state is not time-critical, *i.e.*, configuration can take
 *   time.
 * - Idle: do nothing
 * - Observe: write observation from the actuation interface
 * - Act: send action to the actuation interface
 * - Shutdown: terminal state, exit the control loop
 *
 * There are three possible events:
 *
 * - `begin`: beginning of a control cycle,
 * - `end`: end of a control cycle.
 * - `SIGINT`: the process received an interrupt signal.
 *
 * Guards, indicated between brackets, may involve two variables:
 *
 * - `req`: the current request from the agent.
 * - `stop_cycles`: the number of stop commands cycled in the current state
 *   (only available in "stop" and "shutdown" states).
