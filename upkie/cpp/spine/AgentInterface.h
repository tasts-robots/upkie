/*! Inter-process communication protocol with the spine.

 * Design notes: one alternative was a proper FSM with a clear distinction
 * between states (what the spine is doing) and transitions (agent requests,
 * spine replies, etc.). This could have allowed more granularity, such as the
 * spine doing nothing (instead of sending stops) when it is idle, however at
 * the cost of more complexity. We choose to go for the simpler (riskier)
 * version where both agent and spine directly manipulate the agenda.
