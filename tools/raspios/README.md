# Upkie image builder

An automated OS image builder for new Upkie wheeled-biped robots.

Uses Packer with the [ARM system-image plugin](https://github.com/mkaczanowski/packer-builder-arm), following in the footsteps of the [pupper\_image\_builder](https://github.com/G-Levine/pupper_image_builder).
