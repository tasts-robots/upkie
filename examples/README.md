# Examples

Wheeled balancing is our simplest example: [`wheeled_balancing.py`](wheeled_balancing.py).

When running on Upkie, we often add logging (check out [`wheeled_balancing_async.py`](wheeled_balancing_async.py)) as well as CPU isolation for real-time performance (see [`wheeled_balancing_cpu_isolation.py`](wheeled_balancing_cpu_isolation.py)).
